$ The Ramsey number R(k,l) is the smallest number such that
$ if we two-colour the edges of complete graph of this size,
$ there always exists a monochromatic subgraph of either k or l nodes.

$ In other words (from Wikipedia):
$ The Ramsey number, R(k,l), gives the solution to the party problem,
$ which asks the minimum number of guests, R(k,l), that must be invited
$ so that at least k will know each other
$      or at least l will not know each other.

$ Here, we are modelling the Ramsey-graph problem which is the problem of finding counter-examples.
$ For a given k,l, and num_vertices: find a colouring of the complete graph
$ which does not have a blue-subgraph nor a red-subgraph.

given k, l, num_vertices : int

$ due to symmetry R(k, l) = R(l,k)
where k <= l

$ complete graph, to we can calculate the number of edges
letting num_edges be num_vertices * (num_vertices - 1)

$ we are two-colouring
letting Colour be int(0..2)  $ endefined, red or blue, from function and enum

letting Vertex be domain int(1..num_vertices)
find graph : matrix indexed by [Vertex, Vertex] of Colour


$ the graph is complete
such that
    forAll i,j : Vertex . i < j ->
        graph[i, j]!=0 /\ graph[i, j] = graph[j, i],
    forAll i : Vertex .
        graph[i, i]=0,


$ there isn't a red-subgraph of size k
    forAll subgraph_vertices : matrix indexed by [int(1..k)] of Vertex . 
        allDiff(subgraph_vertices) -> !(forAll i,j : subgraph_vertices . i<j -> graph[i, j] = 1),


$ there isn't a blue-subgraph of size l
    forAll subgraph_vertices : matrix indexed by [int(1..l)] of Vertex . 
        allDiff(subgraph_vertices) -> !(forAll i,j : subgraph_vertices . i<j -> graph[i, j] = 2)
